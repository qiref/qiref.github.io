**English Journal Sharing**

Today, I showed my English journal to my wife. I wanted to share my thoughts with her because I trust her deeply, but her reaction surprised me.

*"Why wasn't I in your first journal?"*she asked. What an amazing woman! She always finds ways to surprise me.

Even now, she playfully envies our son. Yesterday was Father’s Day – we went shopping in the evening, and she bought me expensive clothes that fit perfectly. I was overjoyed.

Later, as we returned home, she whispered:*"You deserve these."*Her words moved me deeply.

That’s my darling. I can't fully describe her... she's like a little shining star in my universe.
