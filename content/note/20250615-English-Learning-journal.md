Weekend Moments

As usual after work this weekend, I went home. My son ran to me and hugged me tightly—I absolutely cherish those moments!

The next day after lunch, he looked exhausted and ready for sleep. Being just a two-year-old, he still needs help to fall asleep. I picked him up, and he lay on my shoulder as we strolled around the room.

Five minutes later, he was almost asleep when he spotted a cookie on the table. He reached for it, so I gave him a piece. Miraculously, he kept nibbling the cookie while drifting into sleep! He looked so busy trying to balance eating and sleeping.

Finally, he fell sound asleep with cookie crumbs around his mouth. I sat down, held him on my lap, and gently wiped his face. What an adorable little one!
