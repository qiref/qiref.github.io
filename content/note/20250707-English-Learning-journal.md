Today was Monday,  the first day int a week.  It was hard to get down to business, I enjoyed last weekend. I made a lot of delicious food in the last weekend. As the old saying said, If you enjoy your food, you must love your life. That was true.  

By the way, My wife prepared her exam in these days, and felt stressful. I knew It was difficult and important for her, but I trust her , she can pass the exam, I often share my journal to her, but not this one. I was afraid those word make her felt more stressful , good luck to my dear.

**Today is Monday, the first day of the week.** It's hard to settle into work. I enjoyed last weekend. I made a lot of delicious food last weekend. As an old saying goes, "If you enjoy your food, you must love your life." That is true.

By the way, my wife is preparing for her exam these days and feels stressed. I know it is difficult and important for her, but I trust her and know she can pass it. I often share my journals with her, but not this one. I was afraid those words might make her feel even more stressed. Good luck to my dear wife.
