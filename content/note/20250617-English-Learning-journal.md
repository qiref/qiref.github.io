If we think stress is bad for our life, yes , those who will often be anxious while being stressed. But ,on the other hand, If we are under stress, it means that we are ready to handle it, speed of heart is higher, so we can resolve the difficult situations, we’ll not be anxious about it.

As far as I concerned, everything on my life are right there, they are not bad or good,  just depending on our mind. The key is how to change your mind. 

### **📝 修正后的日记：**

**Today I watched a TED Talk on YouTube about stress.** It said we can actually become friends with stress. In some ways, stress can be good for us. It depends on how we think about it.

If we think stress is bad for us, we often feel anxious when we're stressed. But if we see stress differently, it can help us prepare for challenges. When we're stressed, our heart beats faster so we can handle difficult situations. This helps us not feel so anxious.

As for me, I believe things in life are just there—they're not really good or bad. It all depends on how we look at them. The most important thing is learning to change your way of thinking.

    ```diff
    - When we are under stress, it means that we are ready to handle it
    + When we're stressed, we're ready to handle it
    ```
    
3. **注意常用词组**：
