**Evening Walk & New Words**

Today was extremely hot. After dinner, I took a walk alone—something I’ve been doing regularly recently. I really enjoy it. Last week at my hospital checkup, the doctor advised me to eat less and exercise more, which makes perfect sense. After my walk tonight, I felt refreshed.

I learned the word "accumulate" today. Here’s my practice sentence:

*By accumulating savings over many years, I can finally afford my dream car.*

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **It was so hot** | 略口语化 | **Today was extremely hot** | 加时间主语更规范 |
| **I often do that in recent days** | 时态冲突(recent用现在完成时) | **I’ve been doing regularly recently** | "近期习惯"用: have been doing |
| **checked my body on hospital** | 介词错误/不地道 | **at my hospital checkup** | 固定搭配: at the hospital / have a checkup |
| **I shouldn’t eat too much and take exercise** | 歧义(否定范围) | **eat less and exercise more** | 医嘱规范表达 |
| **that true** | 遗漏be动词 | **which makes perfect sense** | 完整句需主语+动词 |
| **after finished my walk** | 逻辑主语混乱 | **After my walk tonight** | 用名词代替从句更简洁 |
