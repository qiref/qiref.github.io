      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this weekend, I felt not so good, the sleep time was too late, I spent much time on the useless things, such as shopping apps , social media and so on. I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the reason and I tried to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I lost my self-control, and I asked deepseek, It was said self-control was not against youself, but turn around your attention, If you desired sth, bought sth you not really needed. or delayed sth importan. or watched social media for a long time, just turning around, do sth passitive to replace it and change now, you can eat some fruits and take a walk , or take a deep breath and start your task . Oh, thank the deepseek, That really help.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Everything in this life is impermanent. Today, unfortunately,  I heard many bad news,  a young woman who is my wife‘s colleague, after her second child was born today. I was so sad to hear the news, the poor babies. the poor woman.  Life is uncertain, people never knew what will be in the next day. The traffic accident, the disease, the death… human were vulnerable while facing the natural.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I found I love to stay alone. I’m not outgoing sometimes. In these days, I ate lunch alone, walked alone, and felt free. I could do anything what I want without concerning others. just took on my earphone, and watched some TV shows or read some books. When I was younger, I liked to stay with friends all day, after graduated , found that was hard to make friends, and the old friends was busy, most of them lived in different city and communicated less with each other. They already had their own families , me too. the more I was older, the more I spent more time on family, and the other time, I just wanted to stay alone , and concerned nothing. Now , I wonder Is that life? I’m not sure, but what I believe in is  everything is going to be better.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

There are so manny great thing I want to do, but I spent so much time to the useless thing in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I should be more patient , the problem that I resolved cost one day to finish. In the process, I felt anxious , frustrating, but never gave up. in the end, I found the solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, I must gather enough information before starting, in other words, the context of the problem must be clear. so , I could analyse the problem with the full context. and repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I watched a presentation of TED on youtube, and it said we human beings can make friends with stress. In someway, The stress is benefit to our bodies. It depends on how we consider it. If we think stress is bad for our life, yes , those who will often be anxious while being stressed. But ,on the other hand, If we are under stress, it means that we are ready to handle it, speed of heart is higher, so we can resolve the difficult situations, we’ll not be anxious about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
