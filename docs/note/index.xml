I could do anything what I want without concerning others. just took on my earphone, and watched some TV shows or read some books. When I was younger, I liked to stay with friends all day, after graduated , found that was hard to make friends, and the old friends was busy, most of them lived in different city and communicated less with each other.</description>

It depends on how we consider it. If we think stress is bad for our life, yes , those who will often be anxious while being stressed. But ,on the other hand, If we are under stress, it means that we are ready to handle it, speed of heart is higher, so we can resolve the difficult situations, we’ll not be anxious about it.</description>
