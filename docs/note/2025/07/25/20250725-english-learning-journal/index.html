<p>In this weekend, I felt not so good, the sleep time was too late, I spent much time on the useless things, such as shopping apps , social media and so on. I didn&rsquo;t know the reason and I tried to figure it out.</p>
<p>I lost my self-control, and I asked deepseek, It was said self-control was not against youself, but turn around your attention, If you desired sth, bought sth you not really needed. or delayed sth importan. or watched social media for a long time, just turning around, do sth passitive to replace it and change now, you can eat some fruits and take a walk , or take a deep breath and start your task . Oh, thank the deepseek, That really help.</p>

<p>Here is the revised and corrected version of your diary:</p>
<p>This weekend, I  didn&rsquo;t feel very good .  I stayed up too late  and  spent too much time on useless things , such as  scrolling through  shopping apps  and  social media.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure why this happened , but I tried to figure it out.</p>
<p>I felt like I had  lost self-control , so  I asked DeepSeek for advice .  It said that self-control isn&rsquo;t about fighting against yourself; instead, it&rsquo;s about redirecting your attention . If you find yourself  craving something, buying things you don&rsquo;t really need, putting off important tasks, or spending too much time  on social media,  just shift your focus .  Do something positive to replace the unproductive behavior right away .</p>
<p>For example , you can eat some fruit  and/or  take a walk, take a deep breath,  and then  start your task.</p>
<p>Oh,  thank you, DeepSeek !  That advice was really helpful.</p>
