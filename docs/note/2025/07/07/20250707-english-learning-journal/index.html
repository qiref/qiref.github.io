<p>Today was Monday,  the first day int a week.  It was hard to get down to business, I enjoyed last weekend. I made a lot of delicious food in the last weekend. As the old saying said, If you enjoy your food, you must love your life. That was true.</p>
<p>By the way, My wife prepared her exam in these days, and felt stressful. I knew It was difficult and important for her, but I trust her , she can pass the exam, I often share my journal to her, but not this one. I was afraid those word make her felt more stressful , good luck to my dear.</p>

<p>By the way, my wife is preparing for her exam these days and feels stressed. I know it is difficult and important for her, but I trust her and know she can pass it. I often share my journals with her, but not this one. I was afraid those words might make her feel even more stressed. Good luck to my dear wife.</p>
