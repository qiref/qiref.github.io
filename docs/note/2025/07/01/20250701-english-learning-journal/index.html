<p>Today, I found I love to stay alone. I’m not outgoing sometimes. In these days, I ate lunch alone, walked alone, and felt free. I could do anything what I want without concerning others. just took on my earphone, and watched some TV shows or read some books. When I was younger, I liked to stay with friends all day, after graduated , found that was hard to make friends, and the old friends was busy, most of them lived in different city and communicated less with each other. They already had their own families , me too. the more I was older, the more I spent more time on family, and the other time, I just wanted to stay alone , and concerned nothing. Now , I wonder Is that life? I’m not sure, but what I believe in is  everything is going to be better.</p>
<p>from AI:</p>
<p>Today I realized how much I enjoy spending time alone. I&rsquo;m not always an outgoing person. These days I&rsquo;ve been having lunch by myself, taking solitary walks, and feeling completely free. I can do whatever I want without worrying about others - just putting on my headphones, watching TV shows, or reading books.</p>
<p>When I was younger, I constantly wanted to be with friends. After graduation though, making new friends became difficult. My old friends were busy building lives in different cities, and we naturally grew apart. Now they have their own families, and so do I.</p>
<p>The older I get, the more time I spend with family. My free time? I just want to be alone and not worry about anything.</p>
<p>Is this what life is? I&rsquo;m not sure. But I believe everything will work out for the best.</p>
